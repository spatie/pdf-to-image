This package provides an easy to work with class to convert pdf's to images.

Spatie is a webdesign agency in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Requirements

You should have [Imagick](http://php.net/manual/en/imagick.setresolution.php) and [Ghostscript](http://www.ghostscript.com/) installed.

## Installation

The package can be installed via composer:
``` bash
$ composer require spatie/pdf-to-image
```

## Usage

Converting a pdf to an image is easy.

```php
$pdf = new Spatie\PdfToImage\Pdf($pathToPdf);
$pdf->saveImage($pathToWhereImageShouldBeStored);
```

If the path you pass to `saveImage` has the extensions `jpg`, `jpeg`, or `png` the image will be saved in that format.
Otherwise the output will be a jpg.

## Other methods

You can get the total number of pages in the pdf:
```php
$pdf->getNumberOfPages(); //returns an int
```

By default the first page of the pdf will be rendered. If you want to render another page you can do so:
```php
$pdf->setPage(2)
    ->saveImage($pathToWhereImageShouldBeStored); //saves the second page
```

You can override the output format:
```php
$pdf->setOutputFormat('png')
    ->saveImage($pathToWhereImageShouldBeStored); //the output wil be a png, no matter what
```

### Testing

``` bash
$ composer test
```
